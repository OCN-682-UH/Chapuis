### Header  
This is my first script (for OCN 682). I am learning how to import data

### Load libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

### Read in data
```{r}
WeightData <- read_csv(here("Week2", "Data", "weightdata.csv"))
#here() takes us to the folder where our project is (in this case, "Chapuis")
#Then we specify what folder(s) to go to, then file name
#This code says “read the csv file named weightdata.csv that is in the folder Data, within Week2”
```


### Data Analysis
```{r}
head(WeightData) #looking at the top 6 lines of the dataframe
```

```{r}
tail(WeightData) #looking at the bottom 6 lines of the dataframe
```

```{r}
view(WeightData) #open a new window to look at the entire dataframe
```
